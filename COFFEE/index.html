    <h2>House Blend</h2>
    <p>Here “house blend” seems to describe a blend brought to as little darker roast than a “breakfast blend” though not
    nearly as dark as blends labeled “espresso roast” or “French roast.” Finally, house blends, unique or not, are generally
    expected to offer value to the customer</p>

    <h2>Columbian</h2>
    <p>Colombian coffee is coffee that is grown in Colombia. Colombian coffee tends to demand a higher price because it is
    mostly made up of the superior arabica variety. Colombian coffees can have heavy notes of chocolate and nuts, or lighter
    fruit and floral notes, depending on which department it's grown.</p><br>
